/**
 * <p>
 * Chart component. Chart components can be added to the {@link SOChart} for rendering using
 * {@link SOChart#add(Component...)} method. Some chart components have other components as its parts. Thus, those
 * will be automatically added to the same chart when the component is added. For example: If a {@link ChartType#Line}
 * chart, plotted on a {@link RectangularCoordinate}, is added, the {@link RectangularCoordinate} will be automatically
 * added. However, it is not an error if you add both of them separately.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * You may have this question: Why would I ever add a {@link CoordinateSystem} if I am not going to plot any
 * chart on it? The answer is, sometimes, it may be useful for creating some special effects! {@link SOChart} is like
 * a "canvas", whatever you add as components will be rendered there, one on top of others, unless you position them
 * within the canvas (Many {@link Component}s and {@link ComponentPart}s support setPosition({@link Position}
 * method).
